Stacks:

The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the
collection of objects. It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).

The stack data structure has the two most important operations that
are push and pop. The push operation inserts an element into the stack
and pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.

Empty Stack: If the stack has no element is known as an empty stack. When
the stack is empty the value of the top variable is -1.

When we push an element into the stack the top is increased by 1. In the
following figure,

Push 12, top=0
Push 6, top=1
Push 9, top=2

Top Value:         Meaning:
-1                 Stack is empty
0                  Stack has only an element
N - 1              Top element of the stack/Stack is full
N                  Stack is overflow

Methods of the Stack Class
We can perform push, pop, peek and search operation on the stack. The Java
Stack class provides mainly five methods to perform these operations. Along
with this, it also provides all the methods of the Java Vector class.

Method:             Modifier/Type:   Description:
empty()             [boolean]        The method checks the stack is empty or not.
push(E item)        E                The method pushes an element onto the top of the stack.
pop()               E                The method removes the element at the top of the stack and returns it.
peek()              E                The method looks at the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
search(Object o)    int              The method searches the element in the stack and returns its position.
size()              int              The method returns the number of elements in the stack.
